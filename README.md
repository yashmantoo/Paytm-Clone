# Hi 👋 
This is Yash Mantoo. 
I'm a passionate Full Stack Developer from Pune.

## Project Name : **Paytm Clone !**

In this project I have created a landing page for Paytm from scratch. I fixed a lot of flaws from the original website, and made responsive for all the screen sizes using Tailwind CSS.
I learned a lot from this project, especially about using various CSS properties in Tailwind.
